So, next time you're feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or just plain blah, take a deep breath and grab a donut. Let the sweetness melt away your worries, even if just for a few precious minutes.  You deserve it. Remember, life's too short to resist the allure of a perfectly fried, perfectly glazed, perfectly delicious donut.  Happy munching!
